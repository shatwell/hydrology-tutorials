# hydrology-tutorials in R

## Overview

The repository contains some tutorials designed to teach aspects of hydrology and at the same time provide an introduction to R. There were conceived as part of the module "Hydrologie und Wasserbau" at the [OWL University of Applied Sciences and Arts](https://www.th-owl.de). Tutorials are in German and one is in English. I may add more in future.
